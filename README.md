# Traffic Sign Classifier

This project is a deep learning-based traffic sign classifier that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict traffic sign categories from images. The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which includes 43 different traffic sign categories. Users can interact with the model through a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, or by using command-line tools for image classification. The application is built using TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning, OpenCV for image processing, and NumPy for numerical computations, offering an easy and efficient way to classify traffic sign images.

The classifier can be trained, tested, and evaluated with scripts provided in the project. Training the model is straightforward, and users can customize it by specifying a dataset path and optionally saving the model with a custom name. The repository includes instructions for setting up the environment, running the GUI, and performing image classification through both command-line and GUI interfaces. The project is open-source, licensed under the MIT License, and encourages contributions from the community to enhance the model and fix issues.
